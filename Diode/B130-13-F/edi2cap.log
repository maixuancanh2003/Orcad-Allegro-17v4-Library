   ADVICE: If you DON'T LIKE the result:
    Do another orcadwrite run using one of the following sets of OrCAD writer options:
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.03937 inch(s), 'Grid'=3937 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.00635 inch(s), 'Grid'=635 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.00155 inch(s), 'Grid'=155 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.00127 inch(s), 'Grid'=127 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
