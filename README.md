# Orcad/Allegro v17.4 Library and Automation Scripts

This repository contains a library for **Orcad/Allegro v17.4** along with automation scripts for managing 3D files and adding custom library components.

## Overview

The project includes the following Python scripts for automation:

1. **copy_footprint.py**: Automates the process of copying and managing footprints within the Orcad/Allegro library.
2. **copy3dfile.py**: Automates the process of copying and managing 3D files associated with components in the library.

These scripts are designed to streamline the workflow when handling libraries and 3D model files, making it easier to integrate and maintain custom components in your PCB designs.

## Usage

1. Place the scripts in the same directory as your Orcad/Allegro library files.
2. Run each script based on the specific task:
   - **copy_footprint.py**: Executes the footprint copying process.
   - **copy3dfile.py**: Executes the 3D file copying process.

> **Note**: These scripts are tailored for Orcad/Allegro v17.4 and may require modification to work with other versions.

## Future Updates

**Full design files and technical specifications will be uploaded after the successful evaluation and official publication of the research in a scientific journal.**

## Requirements

- **Orcad/Allegro v17.4**
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed and properly configured to run these scripts.
